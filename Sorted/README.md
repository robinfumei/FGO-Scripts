Names follow the below convention:  
`Order - Chapter - Node Arrow - Pre/Post Battle (0/1)`  
Note that the chapter number used here have been converted to double digit numbers, so as to appear in the proper order. Thus they may not match up exactly with the original file names.

**Unsorted files:**

* `Interlude/`
* `Event/`
